# Project Title

BBC News Classification

## Project description
News articles are text documents which contain valuable information used to automate slow manual processes. Traditional algorithms struggle at processing these unstructured documents, and this is where machine learning comes to the rescue!

The goal of this project is to build a system that can accurately classify previously unseen news articles into the right category.

## Dataset Description
The dataset comes from the BBC which it is comprised of 2225 articles, each labeled under one of 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport or tech.
The dataset is broken into 1490 records for training and 735 for testing.
